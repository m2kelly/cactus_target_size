first extract sequences from hal, using hal2maf script inside cactus container
then run this pipeline to:
1) create bedfile from maf with only alligned bases and insertions removed from human
2) intersect with full gene coords 
3) reconstruct full exons and calculate trinuc target sizes
4) extract strands of genes
5) multiple targets by mutational signatures, depending on strand of gene
